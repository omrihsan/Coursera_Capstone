### This notebook file presents the "Data" that will be used address the Business Problem.

Data Usage and Requirements
We will make use of calls to the Foursquare API using a URL (consisting of the Foursquare credentals and version information) to send a request to the API to search for a specific types of venues, to explore a particular venue, to explore a geographical location, and to get trending venues around a location. The fetched JSON files will be converted to pandas dataframes for data manipulation and exploratory data analysis. We will use the Folium library to visualize the results.

New York Neighborhood has a total of 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods. In order to segement the neighborhoods and explore them, we will essentially need a dataset that contains the 5 boroughs and the neighborhoods that exist in each borough as well as the latitude and logitude coordinates of each neighborhood. We will be relying on the Foursqure API to get nieghborhood location data of existing cafes, resturants, bars and other attractions in Newyork City. We will sort the data according to the popularity, tips, customer reviews and ratings. Then we will study the neighborhood of these locations. After that we will make a dataframe consisting of 100 of the most successful cafes in New York City.

We will use the EXPLORE URL for Foursqare API calls and get a list of buildings, activities and attractions around the locations and correlate which of these compliments the location of a cafe.

After the dataframe for the 100 cafes along with the nearby attractions is complete, we will randomly study 5 different locations in New York City and judge which of the locations is most suitable to open a cafe business. For this we will be using a classification Machine Learning algorithm such as KNN or Decision Tree to first classify the location as 'FIT' or 'UNFIT' to set up a cafe.

Looking at the classification matrix, F1 Scrore, Jacarrd Matrix etc, we will finalize a location to set up our cafe.
